1. How are you unique?
mandatory
At the top of this doc, create a header “Unique List”, and make a list (with at least 7 items) that describes all the ways you are unique.

Some good examples of a unique experience might be:

I grew up with 9 siblings
I have a Bachelor’s of Arts degree from Purple University
I have 5 years experience mowing lawns
I am from TinyTown, Michigan
I’ve hiked the Appalachian trail
I’ve volunteered to work at the SPCA every weekend for the past 3 months.
Eliminate any items from your list that are too personal. This includes age, race, sexual orientation, gender, relationship status.

Now, also eliminate any items that are too generic and almost anyone else could say about themselves, such as: I’m a student, I’m a fast-learner, I’m interested in machine learning.

Everyone should have this on their list: Completed the Foundations Curriculum OR Year 2 [XX] Specialization at Holberton School.

 
2. What motivates you?
mandatory
Create the header “Motivation”. Reflect upon how you’ve made decisions in the past and answer these questions:

What motivates you?
Why do you find yourself motivated by this?
How does this motivation translate to starting a career in software engineering?
What do you need to watch out for because you are motivated in this way?
An example:

I’m motivated by friendly competition both with myself, and others.
I’m naturally a very social person and I enjoy turning the mundane into a game, or a sport. It’s through friendly competition and surrounding myself with the best that I’m challenged to be my best self.
I love that Software Engineering is quantifiable by lines of code written, the brightness of the green squares on GitHub, or tasks completed in a sprint. It has so many tools to setup a competitive environment so I can measure myself against a previous version of myself. It also focuses on optimization, performance and scaling which are all competition-oriented dynamics.
 
3. Discuss your background before Holberton
mandatory
In a section titled “Before Holberton”, list out each of the different kinds of jobs you’ve had in the past. For each opportunity, answer the following questions:

What was the most challenging part of this role?
What impact did you make on the organization?
What did you learn about yourself after working here?
Examples:

Grocery Store Shelf Stocker

The physical labor was the most challenging part of this role.
My consistent attendance and diligence gained my manager’s trust. I would be trusted to standin as the team lead when the Manager was absent.
I learned that keeping a positive attitude goes far in the workplace. When coworkers were down, or tired, adding some humor or a smile to the conversation lifted morale.
Au pair/Nanny

Maintaining the safety of children meant that I always needed to be vigilant.
The twins I watched for 2 years have graduated to preschool. Their teachers have remarked that they are incredibly curious and well-adjusted. I believe I was able to spark their curiousity for the world around them through daily walks in nature.
I learned that I would like to create products or be part of an organization focused on education.
 
4. About Holberton
mandatory
In a section titled “Holberton”, answer the following questions:

Why did you choose to join Holberton? Note: do not use “enjoys problem solving” or “always been good at technology” in your answer
How have you impacted Holberton?
What have you learned about yourself while you’ve been at Holberton?
Example:

I chose to join Holberton because it was one of the only programs that would fit my lifestyle and my learning style.
Having successfully completed the Foundations year as a mother of 3, I am proving the Holberton model can work to help retrain mothers who would like to reenter the workforce and join the tech industry.
I’ve learned that I need more than 6 hours of sleep a night. Amazingly, the stricter I’ve gotten about my bedtime, the more efficient I’ve become in completing projects, cooking dinner and childrens’ bedtimes.
 
5. Something awesome you've worked on recently
mandatory
If you have any software experience outside of Holberton, bias towards discussing a project from that work. If not, choose to describe your final project.

Under a header “Project Work”

Describe the project’s requirements and constraints
Describe the reason you chose to create this
Mention who would/will benefit from your project
Explain in as much technical detail as possible what part of the project was the most challenging.
Note: Much of this should already because you’ve already done a writeup to discuss your final project.

 
6. Tell me about yourself
mandatory
Begin with “I’m a software engineer.”

3 paragraphs, 3-5 sentences per paragraph:

In the first paragraph, explain what you’ve most recently worked on and the technologies you are most fluent in
For the second paragraph, share a bit about your unique background, an achievement from your past, and your decision to join Holberton
In the last paragraph, share what motivates you, and how you can impact a team.
